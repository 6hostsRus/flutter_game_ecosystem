## ExampleIntegrationUpdate (P2) â€” Partial

Purpose: Update `examples/demo_game` and genre modules to use new `game_core` APIs and any migrated snippets. Some demo wiring remains gated by feature flags and documentation updates.

Steps:

1. Replace old imports/usages with new `game_core` interfaces and utilities in the example and genre modules.
2. Ensure scenes build and run; adjust providers/services wiring if needed.
3. Add a short README note in the example about the new APIs and feature flags.

Validation:

-    `melos run example` runs without regressions.
-    Basic gameplay loop and save/ads/analytics hooks still function.

## Next Tasks (backlog)

These are smaller follow-ups that remain after the large consolidation work:

-    Snippets migration remaining items: platformer_player_controller, rpg_stats, ccg/card serialization, survivor_run_state follow-ups (each should include a test and tiny README).
-    Example wiring: add optional Idle demo screen behind AppConfig feature flag and document it in the example README.
-    Persistence adapters: implement a shared_preferences SaveDriver adapter with tests; keep InMemory for unit tests.
