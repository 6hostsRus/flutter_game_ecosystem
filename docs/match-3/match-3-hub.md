Updated: 2025-09-10

**Purpose:** Web portal = stats/social/dashboard embodied as stylized 2D spaces.

## Player Home
- Customizable room as living dashboard: trophies, banners, hero portraits.
- Stats board (achievements, records), message desk (mail/rewards), map table (cross‑game progress).

## Guild Hall
- Shared space: member avatars, seasonal leaderboards, trophy walls.
- Interactive board: kudos/messages, challenge posts.

## Cross‑Game Identity
- Unified profile; per‑game layers; ecosystem events and bundles.
