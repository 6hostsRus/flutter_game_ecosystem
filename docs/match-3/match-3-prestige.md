# Template: Match‑3 — Prestige & Invite‑Only Clubs
Updated: 2025-09-10

**Purpose:** Merit‑based exclusivity layered over paid tiers.

## Clubs
- Eligibility = achievement + prestige combos (not wallet size).
- Seasonal clubs (rotating) vs. legacy titles (permanent).

## Legacy
- Beta/Founder titles remain; some visuals never reissued.

## Seasonal
- Titles and perks expire; profile keeps history badge.
