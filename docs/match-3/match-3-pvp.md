# Template: Match‑3 — PvP Arenas & Wagers
Updated: 2025-09-10

**Purpose:** Prestige‑forward PvP with real stakes that don’t break PvE.

## Arenas
- Weekly sprints → Monthly ladders → Seasonal resets.
- Entry requires wager of progression currency.

## Wagers & Payouts
- Both players stake; **winner 80%**, **loser 20%** (consolation).
- Winner also receives **arena chest** (mode‑specific drop table).

## Rewards
- Exclusive cosmetics/titles/banners; **no raw PvE power creep**.
- Some arenas rotate **mechanically‑equivalent gear with unique skins**.

## Async Option
- Deterministic seeds per match for fair replays and scalable infra.
