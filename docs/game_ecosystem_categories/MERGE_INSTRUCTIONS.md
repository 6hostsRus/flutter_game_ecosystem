# Merge Instructions (Overlay)
- If your repo root has `docs/`, merge contents of this overlay's `docs/` into it.
- Place `snippets/dart/core/*` into your core library.
- Place category snippet files into `packages/categories/<category>/` as appropriate.
- No existing files are overwritten by default; integrate manually if needed.
