Highlights

-    Semantic Parity

     -    Added matrix support to run parity for all specs under `tools/parity_spec/*.json`.
     -    Gated by manual dispatch or PR label `run-semantic-parity`; skips gracefully if the real plugin isnâ€™t in `pubspec.lock`.
     -    Uploads per-package artifacts and posts a PR summary comment linking to artifacts.
     -    See `.github/workflows/semantic-parity.yml` and `docs/SEMANTIC_PARITY.md`.

-    Roadmap & Docs

     -    `docs/roadmap/phase-1.md`: added Pacing & Metrics (quality gates, perf thresholds, analytics presence, artifacts).
     -    Consolidated Ops docs remain canonical under `docs/automation/index.md`.

-    AI Task Library
     -    Reconciled and marked completed tasks as Done in `docs/AI_TASK_RECONCILIATION.md`.
     -    Cleaned `docs/AI_TASK_LIBRARY.md` to reflect no open items for this batch.
