This file is now an index. Canonical content lives in modular docs:

-    Operations: `docs/AI_OPERATIONS.md`
-    Policy: `docs/AI_POLICY.md`
-    Task Library: `docs/AI_TASK_LIBRARY.md`
-    Task Reconciliation: `docs/AI_TASK_RECONCILIATION.md`
-    Stack & Architecture: `docs/STACK.md`
-    Metrics: `docs/METRICS.md`
-    Workflows: `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`
-    How to run (perf/parity): `README_unified_stack.md`
-    Task Execution Checklist: `docs/AI_TASK_CHECKLIST.md`

Conventions:

-    Add new operational patterns to `docs/AI_OPERATIONS.md`.
-    Add/modify task blueprints in `docs/AI_TASK_LIBRARY.md`.
-    Keep stub parity rules in `docs/AI_POLICY.md`.

Do not expand this file with full procedures.

For the standard working protocol and per-task checklist, see `docs/AI_TASK_CHECKLIST.md`.
