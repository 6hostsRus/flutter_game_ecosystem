# Flutter Game Ecosystem — V1 Docs

This package contains first‑pass (v1) documents to bootstrap a reusable, modular game ecosystem in Dart/Flutter,
optimized for rapid reskinning and fast iteration.

**Scope of v1**  
- Core libraries: Characters, Items, Controls, Ads, Database  
- Game templates: Endless Runner, Top‑Down Shooter, Match‑3, Physics Sandbox  
- Monetization loop overview  
- Phase‑1 delivery plan (ship one simple game + foundational libs)

> Philosophy: **Build once, reuse everywhere.** Prefer composable modules with clean APIs, no game‑specific logic in core.
