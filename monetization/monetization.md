# Monetization Loop (V1)

## Pillars
1) **Rewarded video** aligned to *player pain* (revive, retry, extra moves).
2) **Interstitials** with **frequency caps** (e.g., min 120s between shows, not on first session).
3) **Cosmetics/IAP** (stubbed for now) to future‑proof.

## Controls & Experimentation
- Remote flags per placement (on/off, cooldowns).
- A/B toggles for retry vs. revive, N‑runs between interstitials.

## Compliance
- Native platform privacy dialogs, age gating for personalized ads.

## First Targets
- Runner: rewarded retry
- Shooter: rewarded revive
- Match‑3: rewarded +5 moves
